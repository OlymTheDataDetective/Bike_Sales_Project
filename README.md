BikeSales Analysis Project

This project provides an in-depth analysis of bike sales data using Excel. The goal is to gain insights into sales performance, trends, and key factors affecting sales, such as location, product type, and time periods.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Raw sales data is processed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Pivot Tables: Summary tables to analyze sales by different dimensions (e.g., age brackets, gender and commute distance)

Slicer Integration: Interactive slicers to filter data and analyze specific segments of the sales data.

Trend Analysis: Analysis of age group, marital status, and gender for identifying peak sales periods and low performance.

Data Visualization: Various charts and graphs (bar, line) to illustrate sales performance and trends over time.
